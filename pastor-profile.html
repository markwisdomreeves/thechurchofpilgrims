                        idol worshippers, he knew there existed a greater power
                        above. From his childhood

                        <p>Pastor Sarnie and his wife Mrs. Sarnie launched the
                          vision of the church on August 30, 2008 at the YES
                          Building on camp Johnson Road, Liberia with 15 persons
                          in the first service. The Redeeming Time Pilgrims
                          Ministries is an extension of the
                          Church of our Lord Jesus Christ in 1 Corinthians 3:11.
                          According to the Overseer, Pastor Abraham G. Sarnie,
                          this ministry was established in order to bring back
                          children of God who are lost in dead Churches and to
                          prepare them for the
                          soon coming King Jesus Christ. At the end of 2008, Mr
                          & Mrs Quaway Johnson, Mr & Mrs Justin Jallah, Min.
                          James O. Jallah, Mother. Marien Kamoika, Mrs. Caroline
                          A. Caroll and Father. Marvee Wealleh came on board to
                          bring this vision to
                          pass. Later, this ministry was relocated at the
                          Monrovia Demonstration School on January 4, 2009.
                          Liberia. Since its meeting, within the period of 12
                          years has been striving to build a decent place of
                          worship with the little resources
                          as you can see. The church was blessed with the
                          Headquarter land we are presently occupying in Centre
                          Monrovia through the help of the Jallahâ€™s family for
                          the good things the Lord has been doing for them
                          through this ministry. Today we
                          can thank God for His supernatural speed He has given
                          us and for those outside of this ministry who continue
                          to be a blessing. Since its Gathering of the Saints,
                          the R.T.P.M. has launched 4 branches.</div>
