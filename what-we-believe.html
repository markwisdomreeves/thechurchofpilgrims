                      <div class="global-margin-bottom inner-text-container">We
                        believe that the Holy Bible is the inspired word of God
                        and is the only source of knowledge from the Almighty
                        God to all mankind. It is the contact point between
                        finite man and the Infinite God; and its prime purpose
                        is to give mankind
                        a revelation of God (2 Timothy 3:15-17). The Bible is
                        severally referred to as the Holy Scriptures (Romans
                        1:2; 2 Timothy 3:15), the oracles of God (Romans 3:2;
                        Hebrews 5:12), the Book of the Lord (Isaiah 34:16), the
                        word of God (Mark
                        7:13), the word of Christ (Colossians 3:16) and the word
                        of life (Philippians 2:16). It is in two major parts;
                        the Old and the New Testaments. We take the Bible as the
                        final authority in all matters concerning Christian
                        conduct and work
                        – 2 Timothy 3: 16,17; Proverbs 30: 5,6; Revelation
                        22:18,19.

                            consists of three separate, distinct, and

                            united in one. The Father, the Son, and the Holy
                            Ghost are different Persons in the Godhead, not
                            merely three
                            names for one Person – Matthew 3:16,17; 2
                            Corinthians 13:14; Matthew 28:19,20. The Godhead
                            consists of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
                            The Bible clearly teaches that each member of the
                            Godhead is God; separate, distinct
                            and recognizable personalities and qualities
                            perfectly united in one. The Father is called God (1
                            Corinthians 8:6; Psalm 89:26; 1 Chronicles 29:10;
                            Matthew 6:9), the Son, Jesus Christ, is called God
                            (Isaiah 9:6,7; John 20:28; Hebrews
                            1:8), and the Holy Ghost is called God (Acts 5:3-4;
                            1 Corinthians 3:16,17; 6:19,20; Hebrews 3:7-9;
                            10:15,16; Jeremiah 31:31-34).

                                resurrection of Jesus Christ – Isaiah 7:14;
                                Matthew 1:18-25; Romans 1:4; 1 Corinthians
                                15:3,4. “The virgin birth”
                                teaches that Jesus, the only begotten Son of
                                God, was miraculously conceived by the virgin
                                Mary. Prophetically, this was foretold in the
                                Old Testament and became literally fulfilled
                                later in the New Testament (Genesis 3:15;
                                Isaiah 7:14).
