                      <p>Iron sharpens Iron. Men who minister to other men
                        understand the value of forming relationships that
                        facilitate a real ministry. All it takes is one man to
                        have a passion and vision for reaching men in the
                        ministry. The process of organizing
                        and planning will take time and a dedicated group of men
                        to bring the vision of one man to fruition. Once the men
                        in the church see a ministry totally focused on their
                        issues, challenges and interests, they will buy into the
                        vision and
                        soon provide the additional support that is needed to
                        sustain a strong men’s ministry. The goals and
                        aspirations of our Men's Ministry is to get involved in
                        the active pursuit of men in order to connect them to
                        God, His Word, and other
                        men for the purpose of winning, growing, and training
                        God's man in Christ. We know one thing for sure -- God
                        will use the heart and life of anyone who chooses to
                        make himself available to Him. The Bible says, "Go and
                        make disciples of
                        all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father
                        and the Son and the Holy Spirit." This is the great
                        commission spoken by Jesus Himself. In other words,
                        Jesus Christ is commissioning His followers to go into
                        the entire world and reproduce
                        believers. This is the big calling.</div>

                        <p>In our Women’s ministry, we seek to transform women
                          into mature, productive, joyful daughters of the King
                          of Kings and Lord of Lords. We have a great
                          understanding that for a woman to be transformed, she
                          must have opportunities to see how
                          God can use her. She must also know her gifts and step
                          out in faith expecting God to work through her. And
                          when she does, she experiences profound pleasure and
                          usually surprise from the Almighty God. The feelings
                          we experience when God
                          works through us to teach and minister to women can’t
                          be described — only experienced. God wants every
                          believer to know that joy! God expects leaders to
                          offer multiple opportunities for women to serve.

                          <p>The Choir is one the oldest groups in Church
                            history. It is of the Priesthood, dating back to the
                            Old Testament Worship. It comprises a group of
                            musicians that sing and play musical instruments to
                            lead worship in God’s presence. In the Old
                            Testament, the Choir was usually made up of the Sons
                            of Levi who led worship in the Tabernacle. This rite
                            was their sole obligation – 1 Chr. 15:16, 6:31-35, 2
                            Chr 7:6. Because music has an eternal function in
                            worship of YAHWEH, the Choir
                            also becomes relevant in the New Testament Church
                            Rev. 5:11, Matt. 26:30, Acts 16:25. In RTPM, the
                            Choir at the local church level is headed by a Choir
                            Directress who may have an Assistant; both reporting
                            to the Minister-in-Charge of the
                            Choir in the Temple. The department usually
                            comprises Lead Vocalists, Backup Singers and
                            Instrumentalists. They are always at liberty to
                            organize themselves and their activities for
                            optimized productivity.</div>

                              alt=men-department class="custom-floating-image

                            <p>Then some children were brought to Him (Jesus
                              Christ) so that He might lay His hands on them and
                              pray; and the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus
                              said, “Let the children alone, and do not hinder
                              them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven
                              belongs to such as these.” (Matthew 19:13-14) Due
                              to the biblical approach of Jesus Christ, our
                              children department receives an amazing
                              experience, and thus have the opportunity to be
                              influenced by the example of their parents and the
                              congregation. Children are more likely to cherish
                              and delight in the worship of God if they witness
                              that heart for worship in the church. When they
                              see their parents and other adults bow their heads
                              in earnest prayer, or lift their hands
                              in praise, the genuine worship they observe can
                              stir their hearts to worship. Children can observe
                              parents listening intently to the sermon, taking
                              notes and processing the truth they are hearing.
                              They observe this hunger for the Word
                              of God, which can stir the same longing in their
                              own hearts. Learning to sit still in the church
                              service can be difficult for children, but as they
                              begin to listen carefully, they will understand
                              more. Little by little, children will learn
                              about God’s greatness, His love, His holiness, His
                              judgment, and His faithfulness. They will begin to
                              know how He works in the world. Children will hear
                              of His mighty acts and His loving heart for His
                              people. They will begin to understand
                              what Jesus did on the cross and why He did it.
                              Children will learn how much they need to depend
                              on Jesus and how His death on the cross made a way
                              for sinners to be saved.</div>
